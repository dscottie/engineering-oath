First, Do No Harm.

I will respect the hard-won experience of my peers in the development community in whose steps I walk, and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow.

I will apply, to ensure the effective operation of a system, all measure that are required, avoiding those twin traps of both over and under engineering.

I will not be ashamed to say “I know not”, nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the skills of another are needed for a system’s recovery.

I will respect the privacy of client and employee data, for the details are not disclosed to me that the world may know.

Most especially must I tread with care in matters of mission critical systems. If it is given to me to be on call when an alert is raised, then I will embrace my responsibility to ensure that the system is stabilised.

I will remember that I do not solve an issue for a single system in isolation, but a network of interdependent component systems. My responsibility includes these related components, if I am to care adequately for the system as a whole.

I will prevent bugs and unpredictable behaviour whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure.

I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings, both those technically knowledgeable as well as those who are not.

If I do not violate this oath, may I enjoy life and art, respected while I live and remembered with affection thereafter. May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience the joy of software engineering.
